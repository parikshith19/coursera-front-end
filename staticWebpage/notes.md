# Bootstrap plugins
```html
<button type="button" class="navbar-toggle collapsed" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#collapsable-nav" aria-expanded="false"></button>
```
- collapse is not a class used by css it is used by javascript and the *data-toggle* and *data-target* are the other attributes that are used by javascript to make that button
- Use box-shadow for hovering styles it looks good.
